  "Okay, I've reviewed the provided data.\n\n**Analysis of ROAS Decline (Last 30 Days):**\n\n*   **Critical Issue: Empty Dataframe.** The provided dataframe is empty. This means there is *no data* available for the last 30 days regarding spend, revenue, impressions, clicks, purchases, ROAS, CTR, CPC, or conversion rate. Therefore, I cannot perform any meaningful analysis of the ROAS decline, identify creative fatigue, or pinpoint winning/losing audiences or creatives.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Data Verification:** The immediate priority is to verify the data source and ensure that the correct data is being pulled for the last 30 days. Without data, no analysis or optimization is possible.\n2.  **Once Data is Available:** Once the data issue is resolved, I will need to re-run the analysis, looking for:\n    *   **ROAS Trends:** A clear downward trend in ROAS over the 30-day period.\n    *   **Spend vs. ROAS Correlation:** Periods of high spend coupled with low ROAS, indicating inefficiency.\n    *   **CTR Decline:** Decreasing CTR over time, suggesting creative fatigue.\n    *   **Audience/Creative Performance:** Identification of specific audiences or creatives that are significantly underperforming.\n\nI am unable to provide new ad copy variations without any data to base them on.\n",
  "Okay, I've reviewed the provided data.\n\n**Analysis of New Creative Performance:**\n\n*   **Critical Issue: Syntax Error.** The provided data contains a syntax error (\"closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '('\"). This error prevents the data from being properly processed and analyzed. Therefore, I cannot perform any meaningful analysis of the new creative performance, identify what's working, what's not, or suggest further optimizations.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Data Correction:** The immediate priority is to correct the syntax error in the data. Ensure that all parentheses, brackets, and other syntax elements are properly matched and formatted.\n2.  **Once Data is Available:** Once the data issue is resolved, I will need to re-run the analysis, looking for:\n    *   **ROAS Trends:** Identify creatives with high ROAS and those with low ROAS.\n    *   **CTR & Conversion Rate:** Analyze the CTR and conversion rates of each creative to understand user engagement and effectiveness.\n    *   **Audience Segmentation:** Determine which audiences are responding positively to specific creatives.\n    *   **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):** Calculate the CPA for each creative to assess efficiency in acquiring customers.\n\nI am unable to provide specific insights or optimization recommendations until the data error is resolved and the data can be properly analyzed.\n"
