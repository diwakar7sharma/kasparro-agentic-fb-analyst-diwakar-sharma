Subject: ROAS Decline Analysis - Last 30 Days

Based on the provided data, I've analyzed the ROAS decline over the last 30 days.  However, the provided DataFrame is empty. This means there's no data available to perform a detailed analysis of spend, revenue, impressions, clicks, purchases, ROAS, CTR, CPC, or conversion rate.

Therefore, I can only offer a general framework for analysis, assuming data *were* available:

*   **Data Sufficiency:** The primary issue is the lack of data.  We need data populated in the DataFrame to proceed. Ensure the data query is correctly configured to pull the relevant information for the last 30 days.

*   **General Troubleshooting Steps (Assuming Data Availability):**

    *   **ROAS Correlation:**  We would typically correlate ROAS with other metrics.  A decline in ROAS coupled with increased spend could indicate inefficiency. Conversely, a decline in ROAS with decreased spend might suggest missed opportunities.

    *   **CTR Analysis (Ad Fatigue):** A declining CTR over time often signals ad fatigue.  Users are seeing the same ads repeatedly and becoming less responsive.

    *   **CPC Impact:**  Rising CPC without a corresponding increase in conversion rate will negatively impact ROAS. This could be due to increased competition in the auction.

    *   **Conversion Rate:** A drop in conversion rate, even with stable CTR and CPC, points to potential issues with the landing page experience, product offering, or checkout process.

    *   **Audience Segmentation:** We would analyze performance across different audiences (demographics, interests, behaviors).  Identify underperforming audiences to pause or refine.

    *   **Creative Performance:**  Identify top-performing and underperforming creatives.  Underperforming creatives should be paused or replaced.

    *   **Campaign/Ad Set Level Analysis:**  Pinpoint specific campaigns or ad sets that are driving the ROAS decline.

    *   **External Factors:** Consider external factors like seasonality, competitor activity, and changes in the broader economic environment.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Data Verification:**  Prioritize verifying and correcting the data query to ensure the DataFrame is populated with the necessary information.
2.  **Data Analysis (Once Available):** Once the data is available, I will re-run the analysis and provide a detailed report with specific recommendations.


Subject: Analysis of Top-Performing Ads (Requires Data Availability)

Based on the provided information, I am unable to identify top-performing ads or analyze their characteristics due to the **empty DataFrame**. There is no historical data on spend, revenue, impressions, clicks, purchases, ROAS, CTR, CPC, or conversion rate to perform this analysis.

To answer your question effectively, I need the historical performance data of your ads. Once this data is available, I will be able to:

*   **Identify Top Performers:** Pinpoint ads with the highest ROAS, conversion rates, or other key performance indicators.
*   **Analyze Ad Characteristics:** Examine the headlines, descriptions, images/videos, and targeting parameters of these top-performing ads.
*   **Uncover Key Trends:** Determine common elements or patterns that contribute to the success of these ads.
*   **Provide Actionable Insights:** Offer recommendations for replicating successful strategies in future campaigns.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Data Verification:** Please ensure the data query is correctly configured to pull the relevant historical ad performance data.
2.  **Re-Analysis:** Once the data is available, I will re-run the analysis and provide a detailed report with specific insights into your top-performing ads.
